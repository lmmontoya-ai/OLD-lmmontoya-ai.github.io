This blog serves as both a learning log and a way to connect with others who share my passion for understanding how AI systems work and ensuring they align with human values.\n\n## My Background: A Physicist's Path to AI\n\nMy journey began in physics, where I developed a deep appreciation for mathematical rigor and systematic problem-solving. The transition from studying the fundamental laws of nature to understanding artificial minds might seem like a leap, but there's more overlap than you might think.\n\nPhysics taught me to:\n- **Think in systems** - Understanding how complex behaviors emerge from simple rules\n- **Embrace uncertainty** - Working with probabilistic models and statistical mechanics\n- **Value interpretability** - Always asking \"why does this work?\" rather than just \"does it work?\"\n- **Pursue first principles** - Breaking down complex problems into fundamental components\n\nThese skills have proven invaluable as I've delved into machine learning, where we're often trying to understand emergent behaviors in systems with millions or billions of parameters.\n\n## Why AI Interpretability and Alignment?\n\nAs AI systems become more powerful and integrated into critical aspects of our lives, two questions become increasingly urgent:\n\n### 1. **How do these systems actually work?** (Interpretability)\nCurrent large language models and neural networks are often described as \"black boxes.\" While we can see their inputs and outputs, understanding their internal reasoning processes remains challenging. This isn't just an academic curiosity—it's essential for:\n\n- Building trust in AI systems\n- Debugging when things go wrong\n- Ensuring fairness and removing bias\n- Meeting regulatory requirements for explainable AI\n\n### 2. **How do we ensure they do what we want them to do?** (Alignment)\nAs AI systems become more capable, ensuring they pursue goals aligned with human values becomes critical. This involves:\n\n- Understanding objective specification and reward modeling\n- Preventing harmful behaviors and unintended consequences\n- Developing robust safety measures for increasingly autonomous systems\n- Creating frameworks for human-AI collaboration\n\n## What You'll Find Here\n\nThis blog will document my exploration of these topics through several types of content:\n\n### **Learning Journey Posts**\nI'll share my experiences diving into key papers, implementing algorithms from scratch, and working through challenging concepts. Think of these as \"learning in public\"—documenting both successes and struggles along the way.\n\n### **Technical Deep Dives**\nWhen I encounter particularly interesting concepts or techniques, I'll break them down in detail, often with code examples and visualizations to help make complex ideas more accessible.\n\n### **Research Reviews**\nThe field moves quickly, and I'll regularly review and summarize important new papers, highlighting key insights and their potential implications.\n\n### **Project Showcases**\nAs I build projects and tools related to interpretability and alignment, I'll share the process, challenges, and results here.\n\n### **Reflection and Commentary**\nSometimes I'll step back to reflect on broader questions about the direction of AI research, the societal implications of our work, and the ethical considerations we must keep in mind.\n\n## My Learning Philosophy\n\nI believe in **learning by doing**. While reading papers and watching lectures is important, I find I truly understand concepts only when I implement them myself. You'll often see me:\n\n- **Building things from scratch** to understand the underlying mechanisms\n- **Creating visualizations** to make abstract concepts concrete\n- **Documenting failures** as well as successes (they're often more instructive!)\n- **Connecting concepts** across different areas of AI and beyond\n\n## Current Focus Areas\n\nRight now, I'm particularly interested in:\n\n- **Mechanistic interpretability** - Understanding how neural networks implement algorithms\n- **Activation patching and causal analysis** - Techniques for isolating the causal role of different model components\n- **Constitutional AI and reward modeling** - Methods for training AI systems to be helpful, harmless, and honest\n- **AI safety research** - Technical approaches to ensuring advanced AI systems remain aligned with human values\n\n## Join the Conversation\n\nThis journey is more rewarding when shared. I'd love to hear from you if:\n\n- You're also learning about AI interpretability or alignment\n- You have questions about topics I've covered\n- You spot errors or have suggestions for improvement\n- You're working on related projects and want to collaborate\n\nYou can find me on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/lmmontoya_), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/lmmontoya), or reach out via email through my [contact page](/contact).\n\n## What's Next?\n\nIn upcoming posts, I'll be diving into:\n\n1. **Understanding Transformer Architectures** - A deep dive into attention mechanisms and how they enable language understanding\n2. **Implementing Activation Patching** - Building tools to understand causal relationships in neural networks\n3. **Exploring RLHF** - How reinforcement learning from human feedback shapes AI behavior\n4. **Constitutional AI Deep Dive** - Understanding Anthropic's approach to training helpful, harmless, and honest AI\n\n## A Personal Note\n\nStarting a blog like this feels a bit vulnerable—putting my learning process and half-formed thoughts out into the world. But I've found that some of the most valuable resources for my own learning have been others' honest accounts of their journeys, complete with confusion, mistakes, and gradual understanding.\n\nIf you're also early in your AI journey, I hope this blog helps you feel less alone in the process. If you're more experienced, I'd be grateful for your insights and corrections.\n\nThe field of AI safety and interpretability is too important for any of us to tackle alone. Together, we can work toward AI systems that are not just powerful, but also understandable, safe, and aligned with human flourishing.\n\nThank you for joining me on this journey. Let's learn together.\n\n---\n\n*This introduction post marks the beginning of what I hope will be a long and fruitful exploration.

This groundbreaking work demonstrated that attention mechanisms alone, without recurrence or convolution, could achieve state-of-the-art results in sequence-to-sequence tasks.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n### 1. **Pure Attention Architecture**\nThe paper showed that recurrent and convolutional layers are not necessary for achieving excellent performance on sequence transduction tasks. The Transformer relies entirely on attention mechanisms to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n\n### 2. **Multi-Head Attention**\nInstead of performing a single attention function, the model uses multiple \"attention heads\" that learn different types of relationships:\n- Some heads focus on syntactic relationships\n- Others capture semantic dependencies\n- Some specialize in long-range dependencies\n\n### 3. **Positional Encoding**\nSince the model has no recurrence or convolution, it needs a way to use the order of the sequence. The paper introduces sinusoidal positional encodings that allow the model to learn relative positions.\n\n### 4. **Scalability and Parallelization**\nUnlike RNNs, Transformers can be highly parallelized during training, leading to significant speedups and the ability to train much larger models.\n\n## Technical Deep Dive\n\n### Attention Mechanism\nThe core innovation is the scaled dot-product attention:\n\n```\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V\n```\n\nWhere:\n- Q (queries), K (keys), and V (values) are learned linear projections\n- The scaling factor √d_k prevents the softmax from saturating\n\n### Architecture Details\n- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: 6 layers each\n- **Multi-Head Attention**: 8 heads with d_model=512, d_k=d_v=64\n- **Feed-Forward Networks**: 2048 hidden units with ReLU activation\n- **Residual Connections**: Around each sub-layer\n- **Layer Normalization**: Applied to the output of each sub-layer\n\n## Impact and Significance\n\n### Immediate Impact\n- Achieved new state-of-the-art on WMT 2014 English-to-German translation\n- Significantly faster training compared to recurrent models\n- Better performance on English-to-French translation\n\n### Long-term Influence\nThis paper catalyzed the current AI revolution:\n- **GPT Series**: OpenAI's GPT models are decoder-only Transformers\n- **BERT**: Google's bidirectional encoder representations\n- **T5**: Text-to-text transfer transformer\n- **Modern LLMs**: All major language models use Transformer architecture\n\n## Key Insights for AI Safety\n\n### Interpretability Challenges\n- Attention weights don't always correspond to model reasoning\n- Multi-head attention creates complex interaction patterns\n- Understanding what the model \"knows\" becomes more difficult\n\n### Alignment Considerations\n- The architecture's power enables both beneficial and potentially harmful capabilities\n- Self-attention allows models to develop sophisticated internal representations\n- Scaling properties were not fully understood at the time\n\n## Personal Reflections\n\nThis paper represents a pivotal moment in AI history. What strikes me most is how the authors' focus on computational efficiency and parallelization inadvertently created the architecture that would enable the scaling laws we see today.\n\nFrom an interpretability perspective, the Transformer presents both opportunities and challenges:\n- **Opportunities**: Attention patterns provide some visibility into model behavior\n- **Challenges**: The complexity of multi-head attention and deep stacking makes full understanding difficult\n\n## Recommended Follow-up Reading\n\n1. **\"The Illustrated Transformer\"** by Jay Alammar - excellent visual explanation\n2. **\"Attention is Not Explanation\"** by Jain & Wallace - critical perspective on attention interpretability\n3. **\"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers\"** - applying Transformers to representation learning\n4. **\"Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"** (GPT-3) - scaling Transformers to unprecedented sizes\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\nFor those interested in implementing Transformers:\n- Start with the encoder-only version (like BERT)\n- Pay careful attention to positional encodings\n- Layer normalization placement matters (pre-norm vs post-norm)\n- Attention visualization can provide valuable insights\n\n---\n\n**Rating: 5/5** - Essential reading for anyone working in modern NLP or AI safety.
