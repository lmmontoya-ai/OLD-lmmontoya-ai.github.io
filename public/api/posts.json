This blog serves as both a learning log and a way to connect with others who share my passion for understanding how AI systems work and ensuring they align with human values. My Background: A Physicist's Path to AI My journey began in physics, where I developed a deep appreciation for mathematical rigor and systematic problem-solving. The transition from studying the fundamental laws of nature to understanding artificial minds might seem like a leap, but there's more overlap than you might think. Physics taught me to: Think in systems - Understanding how complex behaviors emerge from simple rules Embrace uncertainty - Working with probabilistic models and statistical mechanics Value interpretability - Always asking \"why does this work?\" rather than just \"does it work?\" Pursue first principles - Breaking down complex problems into fundamental c",

This groundbreaking work demonstrated that attention mechanisms alone, without recurrence or convolution, could achieve state-of-the-art results in sequence-to-sequence tasks. Key Contributions Pure Attention Architecture The paper showed that recurrent and convolutional layers are not necessary for achieving excellent performance on sequence transduction tasks. The Transformer relies entirely on attention mechanisms to draw global dependencies between input and output. Multi-Head Attention Instead of performing a single attention function, the model uses multiple \"attention heads\" that learn different types of relationships: Some heads focus on syntactic relationships Others capture semantic dependencies Some specialize in long-range dependencies Positional Encoding Since the model ha",
