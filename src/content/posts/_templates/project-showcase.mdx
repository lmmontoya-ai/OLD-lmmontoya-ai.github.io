## Project Overview

The AI Safety Dashboard provides real-time monitoring and visualization of key safety metrics across AI model development lifecycles.

## Problem Statement

As AI models become more capable, we need better tools to monitor their behavior and identify potential safety issues early in development.

## Solution Architecture

### Frontend
- **React** with TypeScript for type safety
- **D3.js** for custom data visualizations
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design

### Backend
- **FastAPI** for high-performance API endpoints
- **PostgreSQL** for metric storage
- **Redis** for real-time data caching

### Key Features
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live updates of safety metrics
2. **Alert System**: Automated notifications for threshold breaches
3. **Historical Analysis**: Trend analysis across model versions
4. **Custom Dashboards**: Configurable views for different teams

## Implementation Details

### Metric Collection Pipeline

```python
class SafetyMetricCollector:
    def __init__(self, model_id: str):
        self.model_id = model_id
        self.metrics = []

    async def collect_bias_metrics(self):
        """Collect bias detection metrics."""
        # Implementation details...
        pass

    async def collect_alignment_metrics(self):
        """Collect alignment scoring metrics."""
        # Implementation details...
        pass
```

### Visualization Components

```typescript
interface MetricVisualizationProps {
  data: SafetyMetric[];
  threshold: number;
  timeRange: TimeRange;
}

const MetricVisualization: React.FC<MetricVisualizationProps> = ({
  data,
  threshold,
  timeRange
}) => {
  // D3.js visualization logic...
};
```

## Results & Impact

- **50% faster** detection of safety issues
- **Reduced false positives** by 30% through better metric design
- **Adoption by 5 teams** across the organization
- **Open source release** with 500+ GitHub stars

## Lessons Learned

1. **Real-time updates** are crucial for safety monitoring
2. **Custom visualizations** often work better than standard charts
3. **Alert fatigue** is a real issue - threshold tuning is critical

## Future Work

- Integration with more model architectures
- Enhanced anomaly detection algorithms
- Mobile app for on-the-go monitoring
- Multi-language support for international teams
