## Overview

Brief description of what this milestone covers and why it's important.

## Background

### Prerequisites

- Linear algebra fundamentals
- Basic neural network understanding
- Python programming experience

## Progress Log

### Week 1-2: Foundation

- âœ… Reviewed "Attention is All You Need" paper
- âœ… Implemented basic attention mechanism
- ðŸ”„ Working through positional encoding

### Week 3-4: Implementation

- [ ] Build transformer encoder from scratch
- [ ] Test on simple sequence tasks
- [ ] Visualize attention patterns

## Key Learnings

### Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input...

```python
def scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V):
    """Implementation of scaled dot-product attention."""
    d_k = Q.size(-1)
    scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d_k)
    weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    return torch.matmul(weights, V), weights
```

## Next Steps

- Move to multi-head attention implementation
- Study layer normalization placement
- Begin work on decoder architecture
