## Practical Implementation

Currently implementing a transformer from scratch to solidify understanding:

```python
# Key components being implemented
class MultiHeadAttention:
    # Self-attention with multiple heads

class TransformerBlock:
    # Complete transformer layer

class TransformerModel:
    # Full model with embeddings and stacking
```

## Key Insights So Far

1. **Attention is Information Routing**: Understanding how attention dynamically routes information between positions
2. **Parallelization Benefits**: Why transformers can be trained much more efficiently than RNNs
3. **Representation Quality**: How self-attention creates rich contextual representations
4. **Scalability**: Why transformers scale so well with data and compute

## Connections to Interpretability

This deep understanding is essential for interpretability research because:

- Most interpretability techniques target transformer-based models
- Attention patterns provide natural interpretability hooks
- Understanding architecture helps design better probing methods
- Knowledge of training dynamics informs intervention strategies

## Challenges Encountered

- **Mathematical Complexity**: Keeping track of matrix dimensions and operations
- **Implementation Details**: Getting attention masking and position encoding right
- **Scaling Understanding**: Grasping how properties change with model size
- **Efficiency Considerations**: Understanding computational bottlenecks

## Next Phase Preview

Once transformer fundamentals are solid, the next milestone will focus on mechanistic interpretability techniques specifically designed for analyzing these architectures.
