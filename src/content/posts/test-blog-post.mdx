# Test Blog Post

This is a sample blog post created to test the search functionality. It contains some searchable content that should be indexed by our search system.

## Features Being Tested

- Search index generation
- Content extraction from markdown
- Frontmatter parsing
- JSON API endpoint creation

The search system should be able to find this post when searching for terms like "test", "blog", "search", or "functionality".

## Technical Details

This post demonstrates how the unified content system handles:

1. **Frontmatter parsing** - extracting metadata from YAML
2. **Content processing** - converting markdown to searchable text
3. **Index generation** - creating JSON for client-side search
4. **Search functionality** - using Fuse.js for fuzzy matching

When users search for content, they should find relevant posts quickly and efficiently.
