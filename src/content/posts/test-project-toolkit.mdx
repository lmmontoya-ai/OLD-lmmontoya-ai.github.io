## Project Overview

The AI Interpretability Toolkit is a comprehensive Python package designed to help researchers and practitioners understand how neural networks, particularly Transformers, process information. This project emerged from my own need for better tools while studying mechanistic interpretability and has grown into a modular toolkit that others can use and contribute to.

## Motivation

As I've been diving deeper into AI safety and interpretability research, I've found that while there are many theoretical frameworks for understanding neural networks, there's often a gap between theory and practical implementation. Existing tools are either:

- Too specialized for specific research groups
- Difficult to integrate with different model architectures
- Lacking in visualization capabilities
- Not well-documented for newcomers

This toolkit aims to bridge that gap by providing:
- **Modular components** that work with different architectures
- **Clear visualizations** that make complex concepts accessible
- **Educational resources** for those learning interpretability
- **Research-grade tools** for serious investigation

## Key Features

### 1. **Activation Patching Framework**
Tools for performing causal interventions on neural network activations:

```python
from ai_interpretability import ActivationPatcher

patcher = ActivationPatcher(model)
result = patcher.patch_and_run(
    clean_input="The cat sat on the mat",
    corrupted_input="The dog sat on the mat",
    patch_layer=8,
    patch_position=1  # patch "cat" -> "dog"
)
```

### 2. **Attention Visualization Suite**
Interactive tools for exploring attention patterns:
- Multi-head attention heatmaps
- Token-to-token attention flows
- Layer-wise attention evolution
- Attention pattern clustering

### 3. **Mechanistic Analysis Tools**
- **Circuit Discovery**: Automated tools for finding computational circuits
- **Feature Visualization**: Methods for understanding what neurons respond to
- **Causal Tracing**: Tools for tracing information flow through networks

### 4. **Model Comparison Framework**
Compare interpretability metrics across different models:
- Attention pattern similarity
- Activation correlation analysis
- Feature overlap detection

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Hook Manager**
A flexible system for inserting hooks into PyTorch models:

```python
class HookManager:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.hooks = {}

    def register_forward_hook(self, layer_name, hook_fn):
        # Register hooks for capturing activations
        pass
```

#### 2. **Intervention Engine**
Handles various types of interventions:
- Activation patching
- Attention head ablation
- Neuron activation control
- Feature steering

#### 3. **Visualization Framework**
Built on Plotly for interactive visualizations:
- Real-time attention updates
- 3D activation space exploration
- Comparative analysis dashboards

## Installation and Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
pip install ai-interpretability-toolkit

# Or for development
git clone https://github.com/lmmontoya/ai-interpretability-toolkit
cd ai-interpretability-toolkit
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Example

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
from ai_interpretability import AttentionAnalyzer

# Load model
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = AttentionAnalyzer(model, tokenizer)

# Analyze attention patterns
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
attention_data = analyzer.analyze(text)

# Visualize
analyzer.plot_attention_heatmap(attention_data, layer=8, head=0)
```
