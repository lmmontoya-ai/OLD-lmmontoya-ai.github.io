## Overview

This milestone represents a crucial step in my AI interpretability journey: developing a deep, intuitive understanding of Transformer architectures. While I've worked with these models before, this phase focuses on truly understanding the internals—how attention works, why certain design choices were made, and what implications they have for interpretability and safety.

## Why This Milestone Matters

Transformers are the backbone of modern AI systems, from GPT to BERT to the latest multimodal models. To understand how to make these systems safer and more interpretable, I need to understand them from the ground up. This isn't just about knowing the equations—it's about building the intuition necessary for meaningful interpretability research.

### Connection to AI Safety
- **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Understanding how Transformers implement algorithms internally
- **Alignment Research**: Knowing how models process information helps with alignment techniques
- **Safety Analysis**: Identifying potential failure modes requires architectural understanding

## Learning Objectives

### 1. **Mathematical Foundations**
- [ ] Master the scaled dot-product attention mechanism
- [ ] Understand positional encoding mathematics
- [ ] Grasp the role of layer normalization and residual connections
- [ ] Analyze the feed-forward network components

### 2. **Implementation Skills**
- [ ] Build a complete transformer from scratch (encoder and decoder)
- [ ] Implement multi-head attention with proper masking
- [ ] Create efficient attention computation
- [ ] Add positional encodings and test variants

### 3. **Interpretability Insights**

- [ ] Understand what different attention heads learn
- [ ] Identify layer-wise specialization patterns
- [ ] Explore the relationship between attention and model reasoning

### 4. **Practical Knowledge**

- [ ] Learn about fine-tuning and transfer learning
- [ ] Explore scaling laws and their consequences

## Phase Breakdown

### Week 1-2: Mathematical Deep Dive
**Goal**: Build solid mathematical understanding

#### Attention Mechanism
```python
def scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask=None):
    """
    The core of transformer attention
    """
    d_k = Q.size(-1)
    scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d_k)

    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)

    attention_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    return torch.matmul(attention_weights, V), attention_weights
```

**Key Questions to Answer**:
- Why do we scale by √d_k?
- How does masking work in decoder attention?
- What's the computational complexity?

## Personal Reflections

This milestone represents a significant commitment to understanding the tools that will define my research for years to come. While I've used Transformers before, I realize there's a huge difference between using a tool and truly understanding it.

The interpretability angle is particularly important—I'm not just learning Transformers for their own sake, but as a foundation for making AI systems more transparent and safe. Every design choice, every mathematical detail, potentially has implications for how we can understand and control these systems.

I'm excited about the hands-on nature of this milestone. There's something deeply satisfying about building complex systems from first principles, and I expect the implementation work will reveal insights that purely theoretical study cannot provide.
